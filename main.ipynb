    "# Manipulation 1: Spatial domain image filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Image filtering is a crucial operation in image processing that modifies pixel values to enhance image quality or extract features. It is widely used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Noise reduction** (e.g., denoising sensor noise)\n",
    "- **Edge detection** (e.g., detecting object boundaries)\n",
    "- **Feature enhancement** (e.g., sharpening or blurring)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explores **spatial filtering**, a technique that enhances or modifies an image by applying a convolution operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is filtering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering consists of modifying an image by replacing each pixel value with a function of its **neighboring pixels**. This operation helps in reducing noise, detecting edges, or enhancing image details.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main categories of filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Filters** → Weighted sum of neighboring pixels (e.g., mean, Gaussian filters).\n",
    "- **Non-Linear Filters** → Pixel values depend on statistical properties (e.g., median, bilateral filters).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Convolution operation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Discrete 2D convolution formula**  \n",
    "Given an image $ I(x,y) $ and a kernel $ K(m,n) $, the convolution is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$ I'(x,y) = \\sum_{m=-k}^{k} \\sum_{n=-k}^{k} K(m,n) \\cdot I(x-m, y-n) $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ I(x,y) $ is the input image.\n",
    "- $ K(m,n) $ is the **filter kernel** of size $ (2k+1) \\times (2k+1) $.\n",
    "- $ I'(x,y) $ is the **filtered output image**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- The kernel moves over the image and replaces each pixel with a weighted sum of its neighbors.\n",
    "- The larger the kernel, the more smoothing or blurring is applied.\n",
    "- Edge handling is necessary (padding or cropping).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Smoothing, noise reduction, and edge detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise can distort image details, making it essential to apply filters for restoration. There are two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Filters**:\n",
    "  - `Mean filter`: Averages pixel values within a neighborhood.\n",
    "  - `Gaussian filter`: Applies a weighted average, giving more importance to central pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Linear Filters**:\n",
    "  - `Median filter`: Replaces each pixel with the median of its neighbors.\n",
    "  - `Bilateral filter`: Smooths noise while preserving edges by considering both spatial and intensity differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Question:** How do these filters balance noise reduction and detail preservation?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Noise Reduction](illustrations/linear_nonlinear.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge detection is used to highlight structural changes in an image. Common filters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sobel filter**: Computes the gradient in x and y directions to detect edges.\n",
    "- **Prewitt filter**: Similar to Sobel but with different coefficients.\n",
    "- **Laplacian filter**: Uses second-order derivatives to detect edges.\n",
    "- **Canny filter**: A multi-step approach to detect and refine edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Edge Detection](illustrations/edges.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Question:** How do different filters emphasize various edge structures?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What will you learn?\n",
    "- How linear and non-linear filters affect noise reduction and edge preservation.\n",
    "- The role of edge detection filters in highlighting structural details.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Measures the difference between the ground truth image and the denoised image.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Unlike PSNR, which only considers pixel-wise differences, SSIM evaluates the structural similarity between two images.\n",
    "    - It measures how well the contrast, luminance, and texture are preserved in the denoised image.\n",
    "    - SSIM values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match to the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use prebuilt functions for PSNR and SSIM from `OpenCV`, `sklearn`, or any other relevant library. \n",
    "- Compute PSNR and SSIM for each denoised image \n",
    "- During the evaluation process, use these metrics carefully, especially when the original and filtered images do not have the same size.\n",
